# Bank-Telemarketing 
This project analyzes a Portuguese bank's direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aimed to promote term deposits among existing customers. The campaigns were carried out from May 2008 to November 2010.
Through classification and regression models, the primary goal is to forecast client responses to upcoming marketing campaigns so that the bank may concentrate its marketing resources on the most responding customers. The models would lower marketing expenses, improve deposit management, and reduce unwanted client advertising for the bank.
